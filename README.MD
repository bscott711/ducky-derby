Procedural Animation: Ducks use momentum-based speed logic and sine-wave bobbing for natural swimming motion.

Parallax Scrolling: Background waves and clouds move at different speeds to create depth.

Dynamic Camera: The view smoothly pans to follow the race leader.

Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile viewports.
